Cipher Text: encrypted text which got generated
Key: value that sets the output of encryption function.
Plain text: the original text
Salt: Value to enhance the randomness of a one-way function

Cryptography Functions
	Digital Signatures
		Function to verify authenticity
	Encryption
		two way mathematical function which encrypts the data with a key. It could be asymmetric or symmetric
	Hashing
		Once way mathematical function to map the data
			
	
JCA - Java Cryptographic Architecture
	Standard API for cryptography in java
	
JCE
	Its the default provider of the JCA
	It may not support all the algorithms today, we may need to use the third party providers
	
	 
Asymmetric (PKI) and Symmetric (Shared) encryption
	Symmetric (Shared) encryption
		uses the shared key
		Both should have the same key
		
	Asymmetric 
		Uses two keys, one to encrypt and the other to decrypt
			
Never Do
	Donot store the encrypted password in database
	dnt use weak hash algorithms
	never store passwords in plain text

Good password Hashing algorithms
	Use only Not Craked hash algorithms
		Dnt use MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2
	Use only not suspectible to brute force
		
	Inherit slowness
	
Broken
	md5 is cracked and fast to compute
	sha1 is cracked and fast to compute
	sha2 is fast to compute		
	sha3 is not a standard and fast to compute
	
Possibilities
	PBKDF2
	BCrypt
	SCrypt
		
Entropy
	more the entropy , more difficult to crack a password.
	Entropy is more if the length of the password is larger
