Doubly Linked Lists
	As single linked list contain only reference to the next node, its difficult for us to traverse back. And we cannot move back in the list. 
	So, to overcome this issue, we have anew linked list called doubly linked list which will have two references. 
	One to the previous node and other to the next node
	This might not be a memory friendly, but its good to travesal
