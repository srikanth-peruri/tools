Singleton in the application will have only single instance through out the life of the application.
	Ensure a class to have only one instance.
	We cannot call new on this singleton since the constructor is private and not visible to others to call
	we have a static method which will gets executed on the class load. 
	This will generate the instance only once and then it is assigned to the static variable. 
	we will have a getter on this variable for the outside world thus making it a singleton.
	the only way to get this instance is by calling a static method getinstance to get this instance.
	By default Spring framework creates only singletons, we have to specifically mention to create the prototypes
