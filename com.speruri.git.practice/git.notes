Git is a version control system 
Git is a Distributed version control system
It can be decentralised a swell
It massively scales
Git operation are local and very fast
It can be committed to remote GIT repo as well

Why GIT
	It maintains the versioning/history
	It backups the changes
	We can undo changes
	We can compare the changes
	Collabration
	Isolation of changes
	Experimenting the new changes
	Code review
	Context Switching

Who needs GIT
	Any file can be version controlled. Including the Binary version file.
	So anyone who is working on the files can use GIT
	Like
		Software developers
		Text file
		Web designers
		Graphic artists
		Anyone who like to share the code
		
Choices of GIT versions
	There are 2 choices 
		1. Centralized
			Subversion. CVS are examples
			Requires connection to the central server for most of the operations
		2. Decentralised/Distributed
			Most operations are performed locally
			Can be disconnected with source server and can work local
			Tools like GIT, Mercurial(Hg) 	

There are 3 types of states in local
	1. Working directory
	2. Staging Area or Git index
	3. Commit Repository
	
There is a 4th state as well 	
	Remote Repository
	
Master Branch is the main branch in git and we branch the Master to perform changes on the branch for different versions and then finally merge into master
	

git init
	Add an existing project to the git repo

git clone <github repo url>
	Clones the remote repo to the local	

git status
	shows the changes that happened to the files wrt to the HEAD version

git log 
	logs the recent actions in to the console

git log --abbrev-commit
	logs the recent actions in to the console by shortening the md5s
	
git add
	Adds the files modified to the staging area	

git add .
	Adds all the files recursively in all the sub folders modified/added to the staging area	

git add -A
	adds every action like add, delete
	
git commit -m "message"
	commits the changes to the local repo with the mesage we passed
	
git push origin <branch>
	pushes the changes to the remote repo like github to the specified branch
	
git reset HEAD <filename> 
	resets the staged file and move it to the working directory

git checkout -- <filename>	
	removes the modifications to the file in the working directory and makes it equal to the HEAD revision

git pull origin <branch>
	pulls the changes from remote repo
	 
git ls-files
	Lists all the files which git is tracking
	
git mv
	moves the file to a new file

git rm <filename>
	deletes the tracked file
	

git config --global alias.<custom command> "<command>"
	sets the frequently used commands to an alias.

 	
git diff
	Compare the state of the working directory to the repository HEAD
	
git diff --staged HEAD
	compares the state of the staged file to the last commit in the current branch i.e, HEAD
	
	We can also compare two commits using the md5sums
	
HEAD - points to the last commit of that branch
HEAD^ - points to the commit prior to the last commit in that branch
		
git branch -a
	Lists all the branches in the repo
	
git branch <newbranchname>
	Creates a new branch and then switches to that branch
	
git branch -m <oldbranchname> <newbranchname>
	Renames the existing branch to the mentioned branch name

git branch -d <branchname>
	Removes the branch in the list. It wont work if you are trying to remove the branch you are currenlty on.
	
git checkout -b <newbranchname>
	We can create a new branch and then switch to it instead of two steps.
	
If the new branch is added in remote repo and there is no upstream for that branch, then you can fire a request to do so
git push --set-upstream origin <branchname> 	

	
git rebase
	For example, you have created a new feature branch and then you have a master branch
	And there are continuos developments in both the master and the feature branch.
	In such case, at one point you have to merge the changes to master at some point. So avoid huge conflicts
	we can rebase the feature branch to master so that we are with all the latest changes with the master branch
		
	After rebase, the current head in the feature branch will be played back and then the master changes were merged into the feature branch
	and then commits the latest changes to the feature branch
		
	
	
git stash
	saves the current state of the working directory

git stash apply
	will apply the lash stashed changes to the current working directory
	
git stash drop
	drops the last stash		

git stash list
	lists all the stashes
	
git status -u
	stashes the untracked files as well
	
git stash pop
	applys the last stash and drops the last stash with single command
	
git stash save "<title for stash>"
	stashes the changes by giving it a name
	
git stash show <@stash{x}>	
	displays the stash with number x
	
git stash apply <@stash{x}>	
	applies the stash at x to the working directory
	
git stash drop <@stash{x}>	
	Drops the stash x 

git stash clear
	clears all the stashes

git stash branch <branchname>
	creates a new branch with name <branchname> and applies the stash on that branch and then finally drops the stash
	


Git Model
	Here are the layers of GIT
		Just a persistent Map
			Key is the SHA1 of the file
				SHA1 is 20bytes hexa decimal format
				git hash-object <file> will give the hash and which is treated as the key of the object
				Every object in the GIT is having the sha1
				git cat-file <sha1> -p gives the content of the file
			Value is nothing but the sequence of bytes
		Content Tracker
		Repository which takes care of branches, merges
		Distributed Version control
