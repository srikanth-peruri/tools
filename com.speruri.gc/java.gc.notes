In the languages prior to Java like C++, we have to allocate memory to the variable as well as delete the object from memory
Both are our responsibilities. If we forget deleting the object, then we might end up with memory leak

When we create an object, GC will add it to the young space. When we don;t refer that object , then it cleans the object.
We don't know when this happens.
