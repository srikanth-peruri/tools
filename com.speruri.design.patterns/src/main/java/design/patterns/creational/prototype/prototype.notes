In prototype, JVM creates the clones for the pre determined objects. Say for example, if we have a class
with some state when created, jvm uses this object's state and creates clones out of it whenever needed.

we should be careful with the initial state since, bad state in the initial object will effect the other object creations.

The class should implement the Cloneable interface for cloning itself

There are two types of cloning
	1. Shallow copy
	2. Deep copy
